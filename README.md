# DSA-Java
This repository contains my Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA) practice in Java. Problems are solved from platforms like Leetcode, CodeStudio, and discussed in Apna College Alpha 6.0 course. It includes topics like arrays, strings, recursion, sorting, and more, with problem statements and optimized solutions.
